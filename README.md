# Pattern Design Department Performance - New Style vs. Carry Over Analysis
### Project Background
This production analysis is specifically focused on the Pattern Design department within an apparel manufacturing operation. The project tracks and analyzes the pattern development process, which is a critical early stage in the production pipeline that significantly impacts downstream efficiency. Distinguishes between new product patterns that must be created from scratch and existing "carry over" patterns that require minimal or no modification.  

The Pattern Design department serves as a crucial link between initial style design and material resource planning (MER), directly influencing production timelines and quality outcomes. This dashboard was developed to provide visibility into pattern development status, identify bottlenecks, track on-time performance, and help manage the complex timelines associated with pattern creation across multiple style categories and production locations.  

Suggesting this is an active monitoring tool that supports real-time decision making specifically for the Pattern Design team and its stakeholders. The system appears to be used by pattern managers, production planners, and development leads to coordinate pattern development and ensure smooth handoffs to subsequent production stages.
